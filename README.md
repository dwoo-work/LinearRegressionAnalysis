# Linear_Regression_Analysis_using_Python

This will demonstrate to you how to perform linear regression analysis using Python.

Performing supply chain statistical analysis is important, because it allows us to capture uncertainty that arises within the supply chain.

There is a need to analyse and characterise the distribution of the data, because it will give you a sense of how much supply to have, to fulfill x% of customer's demand at any day.

As a supply chain professional, the ultimate aim is to find a balance between satisfying the customer's demand, as well as reducing cost from having unnecessary supplies in the warehouse.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

- pandas: to perform data administration by pulling in .csv or .xlsx files.
- numpy: to perform data manipulation by establishing arrays.
- scipy.stats: to perform data analysis using random variables and probability distribution.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scipy.stats
```

## Sample Dataset

Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data?resource=download). Alternatively, you can download the .csv file from the Github.

## Different Considerations for Linear Regression Analysis

Firstly, we have to find out if the data is having a normal distribution. This can be done, by using the [Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test](https://towardsdatascience.com/kolmogorov-smirnov-test-84c92fb4158d), which will tell us if the sample comes from a population with a specific distribution (in this case, a normal distribution).
